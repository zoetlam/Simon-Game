# Simon-Game
Using Vanilla Javascript

Simon is an electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds played by the game.
The game consists of four colored buttons: **red**, **blue**, **green**, and **yellow**. Each button produces a unique sound when pressed.

The game begins with an initial sequence of colors and sounds played by the game. For example, Simon might play the sequence: red, blue, green.

The player's objective is to replicate the sequence played by Simon. They do this by pressing the corresponding colored buttons in the correct order.

After Simon plays the initial sequence, the player then repeats the sequence back by pressing the buttons.

If the player correctly reproduces the sequence, Simon adds an additional color and sound to the end of the sequence. For example, if the player successfully repeats "red, blue, green," Simon might then play "red, blue, green, yellow" in the next round.

The player must memorize the sequence played by Simon and continue to accurately repeat it. The game progressively becomes more challenging as the sequences become longer.

If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button or presses the buttons out of order, the game ends and the player's score is recorded.
